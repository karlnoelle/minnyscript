`[enter notes for meetup 2]`

event description for reference:

Hey everyone,

Thanks to all that came out to our first meeting yesterday afternoon! We talked through each other's experience with software development and what we're each looking for out of this group. Specifically, there's an app that Substance could use our help with, and we'll be talking through it more at our next meeting.

We'll be meeting at Brookdale Library in Study Room I. It's a bit out of the way of everyone on the East and South end of town, but as we begin to schedule meetings more in advance, I'll be able to snag some rooms in the Roseville or Minneapolis libraries.

Hope to see you there! Bring your laptops, charging cords, and anything else you'd like for brainstorming and talking through projects at a high level.

\- Karl & Rick

ps. I reserved the room from 6:30-9, but we won't start the actual meeting until 7pm. I just added an extra half hour for anyone that wants to hang out beforehand. Call/text Karl at 612-751-8808 if you have trouble finding us.
