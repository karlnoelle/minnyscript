`[add event recap]`

Hey everybody! Hope you all had a great NYE and are ready for an amazing 2018 of CODE.

Join us this Wednesday at my place for a review of wireframes before Rick and I (and anyone else interested in attending) present them on Sunday. We'll cover the basic interactions and necessities of the app, potential screens we'll be building, and try to cover our bases as much as possible so we can get a good amount of feedback.

This Wednesday won't be as much coding as other nights we've had, but this is all part of the process of building an app. 75% of it is planning, interaction design, visual design, and talking through different scenarios. The fun part is right around the corner ðŸ˜›

Hope to see you there!
