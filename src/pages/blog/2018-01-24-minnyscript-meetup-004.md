event description:

Hey everybody, we're back with another programmers meetup this Wednesday at 7pm! We'll be meeting at Rick's house in Eden Prairie.

The plan is to cover, at a high level, several web frameworks that are in use today. Web frameworks (or libraries) speed-up development time and contain many best practices that developers can leverage in new projects.

After that, we'll introduce the frameworks and libraries we'll be using for the app we're building for Substance, and if there's time, get to writing some code!

Hope to see you there,

Rick & Karl
