`[add event notes]`

Hey everybody,

We're back with another programmers meetup this Wednesday! 2 weeks ago we talked through HTML/CSS at a high level and how Javascript interacts with both of these fundamental technologies. We also covered some popular frameworks that bundle HTML/CSS/JS together to give developers a head-start when building applications, rather than coding new projects from scratch each time.

Join us this week as we begin to explore the frameworks and technologies we'll be using in Substance's app. We'll also cover some user experience principles and I'll show a bit of the work I do from a design standpoint that will help when we begin to code the application.

See you then!

Karl & Rick
