event description:
Hey team!

We had a super informative meeting yesterday with Rick bringing us through an entire software development lifecycle. Next we'll begin plugging away at the early stages of a web app, which include gathering requirements, selecting our technology stack, and eventually spinning up a local server to begin the fun part: coding!

As always, feel free to invite anyone that may be interested in learning (and participating in) what is turning out to be a full product build from beginning to end.

We also talked about getting a Facebook group and Slack channel to help us all communicate with each other more easily. I'll send out an email once those are setup so you can all join if you'd like.

Our next meetup will be in Downtown Minneapolis' library on the 3rd floor. We hope to see you there!
