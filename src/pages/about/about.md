title: About minnyScript
---
### We love code
`minnyScript` is open to all; from seasoned developers to people exploring a new hobby, or for the person that wants to know how a digital product works. There's a never-ending supply of new things to learn and our mission is to learn together!

### Teaching
At the meetups, our goal is to have everyone learn something new, whether it's a Javascript method, design tip or simply figuring out what *x* framework does.

### Iteration
We think iteration is one of the best ways to learn and grow in any field, especially when it comes to software development. The first solution is likely never the best solution, so we'll always be looking for new feedback and approaches to solving problems.

### Real-world skills
The things taught and covered at minnyScript aren't some vague, edge-case technologies that only serve a small percentage of projects. Technologies like Javascript, Node, Express and others are widely-utilized by the world's largest software companies. That means jobs! We would love nothing more than to equip you with the skills and talent required to land your next dream job in software.
